    <h2>A focaccia is an italian flatbread usually finished with simple toppings</h2>
    <p>This recipe is like this, like this and that. It is traditionally made with ingredients and eaten by people in Italy. It is a great snack to enjoy with some wine or beer and you can even make sandwiches.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>500g white flour</li>
        <li>350g water</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>65g levain</li>
        <li>15g olive oil</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour in a bowl and mix in the salt</li>
        <li>Add the water</li>
        <li>Add the levain</li>
        <li>Mix until there are no dry bits left</li>
        <li>Let it rest for 20-30 min</li>
        <li>Add 25g of water and fold the dough into itself</li>
        <li>Wait for 20-30 min, add the olive oil and fold again</li>
        <li>Do folds spaced 20-30 min in between until the dough is smooth and elastic. A total of 3-5 folding steps should be enough (but don't add any more water or olive oil in the further steps)</li>
        <li>Wait until the dough rises</li>
        <li>Spread it into a baking tray (oil-coated), add the toppings and some extra olive oil, pressing down the dough to make the olive oil sink into little pools</li>
        <li>Bake that shit at 230°C-250°C for around 30 min or until you feel you achieved desired color</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
